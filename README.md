# NOVA - AI-Powered Smart Tourism Platform

NOVA is a full-stack smart tourism platform that helps tourists discover destinations, create personalized trips, generate AI-powered itineraries using a four-agent workflow, manage bookings, and explore travel recommendations.

The platform integrates a React web application, a Flutter mobile application, an ASP.NET Core REST API, PostgreSQL, and an Agentic AI subsystem to deliver an integrated tourism planning experience.

## 🤖 Four-Agent Tourism Planning Orchestration

The Agentic AI layer is implemented in C# under `backend/Nova.Api/Agents/`.

1. **Destination Research Agent (`IDestinationResearchAgent`)**  
   Researches destination attractions, cultural highlights, and suitable travel seasons based on tourist preferences.

2. **Route Optimization Agent (`IRouteOptimizationAgent`)**  
   Determines suitable destination sequences, inter-city distances, and transport recommendations.

3. **Itinerary Validation Agent (`IItineraryValidationAgent`)**  
   Evaluates budget feasibility, travel pacing, weather advisories, and itinerary feasibility.

4. **Trip Planner Orchestrator (`ITripPlannerOrchestrator`)**  
   Coordinates the agents, manages the planning workflow, allocates budgets, and generates day-by-day itinerary activities.

### Agentic AI Workflow

The orchestration process coordinates destination research, route optimization, itinerary generation, and validation to produce a personalized travel plan.

The AI subsystem is integrated with the application backend so that the web and mobile clients can access AI-powered functionality through the appropriate backend APIs.

## 🚀 Running the Application Locally

### Prerequisites

Install the following tools before running the project:

- .NET 8 SDK
- Node.js and npm
- Flutter SDK and Dart
- PostgreSQL, or access to a hosted PostgreSQL database
- Git

### 1. Run the ASP.NET Core Backend

```bash
cd backend
dotnet restore Nova.sln
dotnet run --project Nova.Api/Nova.Api.csproj
```

The actual local API and Swagger URLs depend on the configured ASP.NET Core launch settings.

- **Swagger UI:** Use the Swagger URL displayed by the application.
- **API Base URL:** Use the configured local API address.

### 2. Run the React Web Application

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL displayed by Vite, typically:

`http://localhost:5173`

Ensure the frontend API configuration points to the backend URL you are using.

### 3. Run the Flutter Mobile Application

```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Configure the mobile application's API base URL for the target device or emulator.

### 4. Configure the Agentic AI Subsystem

Ensure the Agentic AI subsystem is available and its required configuration is set before using AI-powered trip planning.

For a separately deployed AI service:

- Configure the AI service URL in the backend environment.
- Ensure the ASP.NET Core backend can reach the deployed AI service.
- Keep model credentials and API keys in environment variables or the hosting provider's secret configuration.
- Verify that the AI workflow completes successfully.

If the agents run inside the ASP.NET Core application, no separate AI service URL is required.

---

## 🔐 Environment Configuration

Configure environment variables and application settings for your deployment.

Typical configuration values may include:

```env
# Backend
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=YOUR_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING
Jwt__Key=YOUR_JWT_SECRET

# AI service (only if deployed separately)
AgenticAI__BaseUrl=YOUR_AI_AGENT_SERVICE_URL

# Frontend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL
```

These are example configuration names. Confirm that they match the actual configuration keys used by your code.

**Security:** Never commit real passwords, database connection strings, JWT secrets, or AI provider API keys to GitHub. Use a local environment file excluded through `.gitignore` and configure production secrets through the hosting platform.

---

## 🧪 Running Automated Tests

### Backend and Agent Tests

```bash
dotnet test backend/Nova.sln
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
npm test --prefix frontend
```

Run tests from the relevant project directories if your test scripts or solution structure require different commands.

---

## ☁️ Deployment Architecture

The deployed system consists of the following components:

1. **React Frontend:** Serves the web interface to users.
2. **ASP.NET Core Backend:** Handles authentication, authorization, business logic, database operations and API requests.
3. **PostgreSQL Database:** Persists application data.
4. **Agentic AI Subsystem:** Generates and validates tourism itineraries through the four-agent workflow.
5. **Flutter Mobile Application:** Provides mobile access to tourism features through the backend API.

The React and Flutter applications should communicate with the same ASP.NET Core API, which accesses PostgreSQL and integrates the Agentic AI subsystem.

---

## 📱 Flutter APK Installation

To build a release APK, run:

```bash
cd mobile
flutter build apk --release
```

The generated APK is typically located at:

```text
mobile/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

Distribute the APK using your approved hosting or file-sharing method and add the download link here:

**Android APK:** `YOUR-APK-DOWNLOAD-URL`

## 👥 Team Contributions

Document each team member's primary business component, backend and database work, frontend or mobile implementation, testing, and individual Agentic AI contribution.

Update this section with the actual team members and their contributions.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.
- Server-side validation of API requests.
- Secure storage of application secrets.
- Protected database connections.
- Controlled AI tool access and validation of AI-generated outputs.
- Appropriate error handling and logging.

Document only the security controls implemented and verified in the application.
